Medication Reminder Web Application

Overview
I have designed this to help senior citizens and their family members manage medication reminders effectively. The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface where family members can set multiple medication alerts, specify the number of days for each alert, and ensure that the alerts persist until manually stopped. Additionally, users can remove reminders at any time.

Features

Multiple Reminders: Users can set multiple medication reminders with specific times and durations (number of days).
Voice Alerts: Each reminder triggers a voice alert that repeats until the "Stop Alert" button is pressed.
Custom Duration: Users can specify the number of days for which the reminder should be active.
Remove Reminders: Users can remove any active reminder at any time, providing flexibility in managing medication schedules.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface is simple and accessible, making it easy for family members to manage reminders for their senior loved ones.
User Interface
The user interface consists of the following key components:

Time Input: Users can set the time for the medication alert.
Days Input: Users can specify the number of days the alert should be active.
Set Reminder Button: This button adds the reminder to the list and schedules the voice alert.
Stop Alert Button: This button stops the ongoing voice alert and hides itself when no alerts are active.
Active Reminders List: Displays all active reminders, with an option to remove each reminder.

Each reminder in the list has a "Remove" option that allows users to delete the reminder before its scheduled end.
